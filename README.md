## Project 1: Build a Web App using ECDSA

This project is uses a client and server to facilitate transfers between different addresses. Since there is just a single server on the back-end handling transfers, this is clearly very centralized. We won't worry about distributed consensus for this project.

However, something that we would like to incorporate is Public Key Cryptography. By using Elliptic Curve Digital Signatures we can make it so the server only allows transfers that have been signed for by the person who owns the associated address.


## Setup Instructions
 
### Client

The client folder contains a [react app](https://reactjs.org/) using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/). To get started, follow these steps:

1. Open up a terminal in the `/client` folder
2. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the application 
4. Now you should be able to visit the app at http://localhost:5173/

### Server

The server folder contains a Node.js server using [express](https://expressjs.com/). To run the server, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal within the `/server` folder 
2. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies 
3. Run `node index` to start the server

_Hint_ - > Run `npm i -g nodemon` and then run `nodemon index` instead of `node index` to automatically restart the server on any changes!

The application should connect to the default server port (3042) automatically!

## 🏁 The Goal: Set Up a Secure ECDSA-based Web Application

This project begins with a client that is allowed to transfer any funds from any account to another account. That's not very secure. By applying digital signatures we can require that only the user with the appropriate private key can create a signature that will allow them to move funds from one account to the other. Then, the server can verify the signature to move funds from one account to another.
